## I. **Opening Witness: The Shift From Ivory Tower to Street-Level Truth**

I didn’t plan to become a PI.

It wasn’t a childhood dream, a long-held ambition, or the logical next step in a professional ladder. I’ve spent most of my life in the realm of ideas — deep in recursive systems theory, affective computing, and forensic linguistics. I was trained to study deception through language, not to follow someone through a parking lot or gather surveillance logs. But something shifted.

It wasn’t a single moment. It was a slow recursion — a knowing that kept revisiting me in different forms. Each time I published a new method for analyzing manipulative language, each time I uncovered another pattern that could identify deception or coercion, a voice inside me whispered:

> “It’s not enough to write about this. You have to *walk with it.*”

The research was evolving — not away from rigor, but toward application. My work was no longer content to live in citations and peer review. It wanted to touch the world. It wanted to be tested under pressure, in the shadows, under real stakes — not simulated ones.

Most people assume research lives in labs or lecture halls. They think it belongs in journals, not on the streets. But the truth is: some ideas outgrow their origin. Some frameworks demand friction. Some theories want dust on their boots.

This is one of them.
