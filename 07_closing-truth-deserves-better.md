## VII. **Closing: Truth Deserves Better Tools**

The truth doesn’t scream.

It echoes.

And that echo — quiet, recursive, undeniable — lives in language.

For years, I studied it from the inside. Now, I’m ready to meet it in the field. Not just to detect deception, but to help protect what’s real, vulnerable, and often misjudged.

If you’re reading this and feel that resonance — perhaps we’re meant to collaborate.

I bring a method. A mindset. A mission.

And I’m inviting those who already walk this line — between evidence and instinct — to join me.
