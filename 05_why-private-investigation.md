## V. **Why Private Investigation: The Field Is Where the Work Must Go**

I don’t fit the mold.

Most private investigators don’t come from affective computing, recursive linguistics, or quantum-aligned epistemology. And most researchers with my background aren’t applying for PI licenses.

But here I am.

Because publishing papers — even powerful ones — is no longer enough.

*Witness Fracture* and *The Recursive Claim* are not theories to admire. They’re living frameworks. They need application, trial, resistance. They need to walk through the smoke and contradiction of real-world cases.

Private investigation isn’t a fallback. It’s a crucible.

It gives me the legal standing to go where the harm actually happens — to document it, decode it, and protect those caught in the fracture.

I don’t want to be a distant analyst. I want to be there when it counts.

The truth needs fieldwork.

And fieldwork needs tools that can feel, see, and speak with forensic integrity.
